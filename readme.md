Verbeterdebuurt 2.0 is a web client that communicates with Verbeterdebuurt through the Verbeterdebuurt API 
It's currently in the mock-up phase. For design and documentation see /doc

TODO: 
- Work pages and documentation into UX-design (link to blog).
- Connect the mockup with the API.
- Place the mapwidgets absolute (the block the map now).
- Have the map load issues dynamically with caching (see VDB 1 for snippets).
- Implement OAuth for loging and registering (needs API work).
- Implement Opt-in for newsletter (needs API work). 
- Design document and implement smoke tests
